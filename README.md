# :sun_behind_large_cloud: What's Up - Simple Weather App :cloud_with_snow:

[What's Up] is the simple to use weather lookup app. Giving you the latest weather data of the day in any region you can think of!

This App was built within a day for a technical challenge, and to accelerate my understanding of Fetching API data and processing it to be displayed to a user.

## Tech Stack

- Javascript ES6
- HTML5
- CSS3
- API (https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Design Stack

- Lunacy (Design Tool)
- LucidGraph (Flow Chart)

## Running

This app is very simple to run, you can use any hosting applicaiotn such as Xampp or just live-server within VS Code. Simply open uo the main index.html file and you're good to go!

## Desktop version screenshots

The weather app was designed with a desktop first approach leading to the design fitting from screen sizes of 1440p down to 720p with no issues.

## Mobile version screenshots

The desktop first approach was then modified to suit the needs of mobiles and will scale down according to screen size on each device.
